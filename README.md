 A simple yet complex simulation of slime molds. The true beuaty of this simulation reveals itself in the simplicity of its rules:


            🍄~400 spores are released from the center

            👀 A spore has two sensors placed above and to the right and left of
             the direction in which its facing

            🧲 If one of the sensors senses the pheromone of another spore of
              the same color, it will move towards it

            🎃If one of the sensors senses the pheromone of another spore of a
              different color, it will move away from it

And I also added a way to draw in a pheromone that attracts the white spores and repels the blue ones.

Inspired heavily by Sebastian Lagues video on Ant and Slime Simulations.
